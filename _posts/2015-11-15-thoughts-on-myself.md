After a few weeks resting, i come back to work again. During the process struggling with contradictory emotion, i rethink what's important for me.

----

### Goal
First of all, what's goals of myself? What i want to achieve in next few years. I want to graduate from current school successfully. I hope i can get better education. I want to get a Ph.D degree!

### Plan
To achieve the goals, what i have to do? 

### Execution
How to execute the plan? What if i get lazy again? How can i return back to work from abnormal status? Where do i get power? How to ensure the quality of the plan execution?

### Evaluation
Am i in my better condition everyday? What grade will i give to myself?
