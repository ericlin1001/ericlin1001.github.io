# How to auto connect to a wifi that needs login manually?

# Situation 
Everyday I'm always have to login in my school wifi manually, and I want to auto login wifi once the wifi is avaible.

# My solution
1. First, download 2 apps: Tasker, RESTask.
2. Second, configure Tasker to detect whether or not connect to that specific wifi, if connected, use RESTask to do a Http Post to auto login.
