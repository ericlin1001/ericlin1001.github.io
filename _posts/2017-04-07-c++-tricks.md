# Funny tricks
`#define foo(...) printf(__VA_ARGS__);`

# Unused
The following snippet can be used to suppress the warning: unused-result.
```
template<typename T>
void inline UNUSED(const T&){} 
```
It works well and do NOT affect any efficency in c++.

# Float trap
## Guess what's the output of the following program?
~~~
int i=0;
for(double x=0;x<10;x+=0.1){
	i++;//we means to run i++ 100 times.
}
//here, we thought i=100.
cout<<i<<endl;
~~~
I run it in my linux computer, and it outputs `101`, incredibly right?
The secret is, when adding 0.1 to a double variable `x` 100 times, it could be x may not equal to 10 exactly.

## Run the following code to investiage what happens meanwhile?
~~~
int i=0;
for(double x=0;x<10;x+=0.1){
	i++;
	cout<<i<<setprecision(20)<<x<<endl;
}
cout<<i<<endl;
~~~
In a nutshell, this is caused by accumulated float error.

# Sort trap
To use function `sort` in <algorithm>, be careful of the user-defined compare function, which must be a Strick weak ordering, i.e. satisfying following conditions:
* irreflexive: For all a, comp(a,a)==false
* antisymmetric: if comp(a,b)==true, then comp(b,a)==false
* transitive: if comp(a,b)==true and comp(b,c)==true then comp(a,c)==true.

There is a error case, extracted from a project. This program will crash. If you're interested, try to find out why!
